# RubyGuesser

This was created for fun during the New Year's holiday.

## Motivation

- I want to make a quick game to play with my colleagues.
- I want to play on https://github.com/ruby/ruby.wasm

## Development policy

- Keep it simple except for ruby.wasm
- Make it easy to deploy. Use GithubPages
- Make it easy to develop. Use GithubCodeSpaces
